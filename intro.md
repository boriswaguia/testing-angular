        * Decision table
        * Cause-Effect Graphing Technique
    1. Structural Testing
        * Path Coverage Evaluation using Cyclomatic Complexity
        * Data Flow (Using programs states: no data, single, multiple)
1. Part two: Applied testing strategy (Lab)

1. Conclusion
    1. Testing is not a complete science
    1. We can use one or more testing strategy. Important is to use the one that suit you and measure defects over time.
